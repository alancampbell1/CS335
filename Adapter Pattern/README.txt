Notes on Adapter Pattern:
In general, a software design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem.
Design Patterns can show the relationships and interactions between classes and objects.

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that the client 
expects.
It adapts one object to another one.
It lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
It allows the reuse of existing code without changing it.
Note, it only converts interfaces, while other patterns, such as decorator, allows new functionality
to be added to an existing interface.

Annotations in Java:
They start with an '@' and do not change the action of a compiled program.
They help associate metadata (information) to the program elements, such as instance variables,
constructors, methods, classes etc.
