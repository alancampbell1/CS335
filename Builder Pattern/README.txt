Builder Pattern:
Normally when creating an object, details such as instantiating and initialising the components
are kept within the object as part of the constructor.
This approach is fine for simple objects and the construction process is definite and always
creates the same representation of the object.

However, this approach may be ineffective when the object is complex or the steps in the 
object creation process can be implemented in different ways, creating different representations
of the object.
